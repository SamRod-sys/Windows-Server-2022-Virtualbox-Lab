Installed Windows Server 2022 on Oracle virtualbox for local IT lab practice

## Overview
This lab documents the installation of Windows Server 2022 on Oracle VirtualBox to build foundational experience with server operating systems and virtualization concepts.

## Tools Used
- Oracle VirtualBox
- Windows Server 2022 ISO
- Host OS: Windows 11

## Lab Objectives
- Install and configure a Windows Server 2022 virtual machine
- Gain familiarity with virtualization concepts
- Prepare environment for future Active Directory and domain labs

## Steps Performed
1. Installed Oracle VirtualBox on host machine
2. Downloaded Windows Server 2022 ISO from Microsoft
3. Created a new virtual machine in VirtualBox
4. Configured VM settings (memory, CPU, storage)
5. Installed Windows Server 2022 on the virtual machine
6. Verified successful installation and server boot

## Result
- Windows Server 2022 successfully installed and running in VirtualBox
- Server ready for future configuration (Active Directory, DNS, users, groups)

## Notes / What I Learned
- How virtual machines isolate operating systems from the host
- Basic VM resource allocation (CPU, RAM, storage)
- Initial Windows Server installation workflow

## Next Steps
